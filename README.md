As most know, the NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament, or March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament with 68 teams where favorites tend to always fall. There has never been a perfect bracket of predicting the tournament, but lets try and be the first! Meet us on Wednesday where using model building techniques in R, we will create models using a variety of datasets to try and predict the craziness of March.
